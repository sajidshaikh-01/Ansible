Why Handlers are used in production?

| Without Handler              | With Handler           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Restart happens every run    | Restart only if needed |
| Unnecessary downtime         | Zero downtime          |
| Slower                       | Faster                 |
| Risk of service interruption | Safe deployment        |
